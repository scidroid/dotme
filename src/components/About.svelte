    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is Juan, a 13 years dev from Colombia, I became more
        interested in programming in December 2020 and I'm passionate about
        software development, my favorite language is Python, although I have
        experimented and worked with JavaScript, HTML and CSS and a bit of Ruby,
        Java and C.
    </p>
    <p>
        My first line of code was done at
        <a href="https://code.org/">Hour Of Code</a>, since then I have been
        involved and interested in interesting technologies like backend
        programming, artificial intelligence, Data Science and a few other
        things, I have also had the opportunity to teach other people which has
        given me a lot of fun and learning.
